## What is productivity-maxxing

To me _productivity-maxxing_ means one thing: **ruthlessly optimizing my day for more positive output**.

How do I do I finish the feature that I've been working on?
How do I also make time to help my co-worker?
How do I also deal with this customer issue that came up just now?

Over the years I've explored many options on how to do this and it turns out that I really
enjoy trying new productivity ideas. Productivity-maxxing has became quiet a hobby of mine.


## Why it became necessary

Looking back at myself just after graduating I was eager to prove everyone how smart I was and how much I
could achieve through pleasing my co-workers and users.
So I took on as many projects as I was able to finish while clocking in a LOT of overtime.
I worked until 7-8 pm every night from soon after waking up. I even spent my weekends working because I did
not have much else to do for 2-3 years. It wasn't healthy and I came close to burning out, but let's talk about
that some other time.

It did not matter how hard I tried, eventually life happened and unplanned issues came up. These would have been fine
if I wasn't already stretched too thin. This created my need to optimize my productivity.

## Bullet journaling

This is still my biggest breakthrough and what ignited this passion of mine.
As it turns out I really struggle to keep organized on a busy day at work.
This co-worker asks me to reset their password, my manager wants an update on a project, my team-mate wants to book a meeting in the afternoon, ohh and don't forget to email the lawyer to ask for an update.
It is impossible for me to keep all these things in my head and not forget about something.

With a [bullet journal](https://bulletjournal.com/) remembering is easy. Just put down a task for today and move on. Things became instantly out-of-mind and this removed a lot of mental fatigue from my every days.

I started with a physical journal, but quickly felt that I was missing out by not being able to search it.
Then I bought an iPad for hand writing these notes, but that wasn't actually working.
I now feel like this was a mistake and I would encourage anyone to instead try my next iteration before buying any hardware for a bullet journal.
Nowadays; I use a free app, [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) as my journal.
This app fits bullet journalling naturally with its daily pages and tags.
Also copying a paragraph's reference into the next day helps me beautifully track how long things took.

One added benefit of this is that I can always look back in my journal and answer the question "What did you do last week?".
A tag to keep track of impactful contributions makes my life much easier at performance evaluation time.

For an example on how to use Logseq as a work journal check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJclYLS4oHs).

## Second brain

For my personal-life I much prefer using my [second brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/book).

Tiago starts off this book with the fact that our brain is not good at remembering things perfectly
(certainly not mine) and it is not good at keeping previous thoughts organized.
Your second, silicon based brain on the other hand is perfect for these purposes.

I find this organization method to be better suited for longer-term projects where things need to be pulled up months later.
It's also just so simple to follow. I never have to think about where a new note goes, I just follow the the underlying PARA method.

Again, this helps me removes mental fatigue form my life.

## Other things that work for me

* [Deep work](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1455586692): This book explains the flow state that I noticed while attending university and explains how to reach it.
* LOFI music: I actually saw a [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=em34-rKofOg&pp=ygUUaG93IGxvZmkgbXVzaWMgd29ya3M%3D) recently that explains how they work. I'm a big fan! You might also see me at work bobbing to some EDM DJ set in, here's [the one I was listening to today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CT6HxYA0cg).

## Calendar blocking

This one is difficult for me as I don't truly use it.

I think the underlying idea is great: bunch related tasks together to allow deep work to take place.
However; my work-life has been too chaotic for this to work well and in my personal life I'm too lazy to follow a schedule.

This technique also removes mental fatigue, so I hope that it will work for me in the future. Until then I will keep it in mind.

If there's any idea that you think I missed please let me know. My email can be found on the bottom of the page.
