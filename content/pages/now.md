 (This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), and if you have your own site, [you should make one](https://nownownow.com/about))

My current personal coding projects live on my [GitHub account](https://github.com/keller00/), please look there for what I'm currently tinkering on.

## Nix

I'm trying out `nix` with `direnv` to see how it can simplify my local developer environment setup on both my local computers and in CI.

## Full-time Linux User

I've embraced Arch Linux full-time now. If you see me post then that means my computer is still working.

## A new chapter

I recently switched from working on external Python libraries to internal tooling at Snowflake.

I always really enjoyed working on small scripts and CLIs that make my co-workers' lives easier. I also really enjoy helping my friends, so this move felt natural.

## In a previous life

I was studying Computer Science at the University of Waterloo.

You might have also seen me at one of these places doing these things:
* Snowflake: working on various Python client libraries and internal tooling
* Nvidia: working on their own cloud solution
