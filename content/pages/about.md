title: "About me"
---

My name is Mark Keller.  

I am a University of Waterloo alumni, from Canada who is currently working at Snowflake. I like to tinker with my computer.

I have been mostly a Python developer, but I have experience with Scala, C, C++, Java.

I have worked on many of my own projects, which can be found on my [GitHub account](https://github.com/keller00/).

You might have also seen me at one of these places doing these things:
* Snowflake: working on various client libraries and some server-side features of their database
* Nvidia HQ: working on their cloud solution
* Evertz Microsystem: developing video applications and doing devops work
